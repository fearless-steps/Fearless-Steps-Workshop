<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The field of speech communications has seen extensive advancements in speech technology as well as
communication sciences for human interaction. While many speech and language resources have been
established, few exist which focus on team based problem solving in naturalistic settings. The main
challenge in establishing such a resource is the ability to capture such audio in a consistent manner, and
ensure proper associated meta-data and content knowledge is provided to allow speech/language
processing research, speech communications investigation, as well as speech technology innovation
based on machine learning advancements. Privacy constraints, as well as willingness for large teams to
be recorded with subsequent audio and meta-data shared represent the primary obstacle to overcome.<br><br>
To address this, the Fearless Steps APOLLO Community Resource, supported by NSF, is an ongoing massive
naturalistic communications resource for researchers, scientists, historians, and technology innovators to
advance their fields. Historically, the NASA Apollo program represents one of mankind’s most significant
technological challenges to place a human on the moon. This series of manned speech missions were
made possible by the dedication of an extensive group of committed scientists, engineers, and specialists
who collaborated harmoniously, showcasing an extraordinary level of teamwork. Voice communications
played a key role in ensuring a coordinated team effort, which ensure success of each mission and
leveraged team member’s strengths and scientific knowledge/experience. The speech & language
community has a substantial need for extensive Big Data speech corpora, as it is crucial for advancing
next-generation technologies in the field. The primary objective of the proposed workshop is to bring the
SPS members together to explore and address urgent needs within the speech/language community that
can advance our field through the massive naturalistic Fearless Steps APOLLO corpus. <br>
This workshop aims to feature keynote speakers, host panel discussions, present state-of-the-art research
findings, and share both resources and best practices in exploring what will be the largest publicly
available naturalistic multi-speaker team based historical audio and meta-data resource.

<h2>Workshop Agenda</h2>

<p> COMING SOON </p>
<!--
<p>• We propose a thought-provoking workshop at ICASSP 2024, dedicated to the
exploration of the Fearless Steps APOLLO Naturalistic Corpus and its profound
implications for the speech processing community. This workshop aims to
complement the main conference by delving into emerging fields that
leverage the corpus for groundbreaking research. The workshop will generate
new momentum in the field, fostering collaborative discussions, and unveiling
innovative research avenues. Fearless Steps APOLLO Corpus is a unique audio
resource, and as of July 2023, comprised of speech data from Apollo Missions
1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, & 14 supplemented with pipeline diarization
transcripts. A research-focused manually transcribed subset of each of these
missions is being released for continued SLT development. With advancements in speech
recognition, speaker diarization, and speech activity detection, researchers can extract invaluable

5
insights from this corpus. Our workshop will showcase the potential applications of this corpus in
speech technologies for challenging environments, such as space missions, underwater
exploration, team-based organizational events/meetings, and noisy industrial settings.
• The relevance of this workshop lies in its potential
to revolutionize the speech processing landscape.
By combining state-of-the-art methodologies and
novel algorithms, researchers can pioneer new
approaches in speech recognition, unsupervised
learning, and natural language processing. The FSAPOLLO Corpus aims to empower attendees to
explore the frontiers of speech research and
develop robust models for real-world scenarios.
Furthermore, our workshop will feature
renowned speakers who have already made
significant contributions in utilizing large-scale
corpora like Fearless Steps Corpus. They will share
their insights on the latest breakthroughs and
present case studies demonstrating the corpus’
impact on core speech processing tasks.
• We envision this workshop as a melting pot of
ideas and collaborations, encouraging researchers
to break boundaries in speech processing.
Participants will have the opportunity to share
their findings, exchange knowledge, and form partnerships for future research endeavors.

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>The Fearless Steps corpus is derived fom a five-year NSF CISE funded project awarded to CRSS at the University of Texas at Dallas. UTDallas-CRSS established the hardware/software solutions to digitize and diarize 19,000 hrs of NASA Apollo data. All core Apollo data released as part of this challenge has been approved for public release by NASA Export Control. The full audio corpus is also available through UTDallas-CRSS. Any reference to or listing of organizations other than UTD is for information only; it does not imply recommendation or endorsement by UTDallas-CRSS nor does it imply that the products mentioned are necessarily the best available for that purpose. </p>
